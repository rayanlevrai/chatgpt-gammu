# chatgpt-gammu
Hi, this is my first real script in Python. I am very beginner yet, and I know my code isn't perfect but I try to do my best and I'll upgrade this later when I get more experience. If you are any suggestion or somethings, let me know !

My Discord : C'estRayan#6550 

Before run the code, make sure of your are already created the table `whitelist` with colonnes `name` and `phone_number` for only accept request of certains peoples and not everyone (security issue). 

For this : 
- Make sure your are installed and setup MySQL with phpMyAdmin.
- Complete your informations in `db_sql.py` before run it.

Now you are just complete few informations in `chatgpt.sh` script and modify the RunOnReceive in `/etc/gammu-smsdrc` for teh script path and you are ready for launch !
